Requires CyclopsCore version 1.17.0 or higher.

Additions:
* Allow reusable recipe ingredients, Closes #36
  If the player marks a recipe ingredient as reusable, this ingredient
  will not be crafted multiple times if the recipe is requested in bulk.
  This is useful for recipes that make use of items that only consume
  durability if they are used in a recipe.
* Add option to crafting interfaces to disable blocking mode
  When this option is enabled, the crafting interface will try to push as
  much parallel crafting jobs into the target as possible for bulk
  crafting jobs.
  This is mainly useful for machines that can process multiple inputs in
  parallel.
  Closes #90

Changes:
* Allow jobs to partially start if dependencies are not fully finished
  This fixes issues with multi-amount jobs with many dependencies,
  where the root job would not be able to start unless the dependencies would
  be fully finished.
  For example, recipes that involve chains of multiple machines
  will result in more efficient pipelining.
  Closes #6
* Only craft missing number of items in Crafting Writer
  This will now properly take into account the stacksize of items as desired amount.
  Closes #77
