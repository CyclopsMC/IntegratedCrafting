Requires CyclopsCore version 1.4.0 or higher.

Fixes:
* Set (configurable) limit of 256 pending crafting jobs per interface
  This fixes server memory and CPU issues when serializing/deserializing
  lists of many pending jobs.
  This could for example occur when an IT exporter had a crafting option
  enabled that would continuously create new jobs.
  Closes #32
  Closes #34
* Fix recipes with missing alternatives being counted incorrectly
  This could occur with oredict-based recipes, Closes #33
